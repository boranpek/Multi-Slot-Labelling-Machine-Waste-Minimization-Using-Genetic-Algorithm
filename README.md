The subject of this project is to produce the products desired to be produced by making minimum waste. In summary, there are demands that I need to meet based on orders, I have to meet them completely. Since it is started to be produced on the same machine, it is produced in the same number of products for each product. For this reason, I try to minimize waste. My goal throughout the project is to minimize the amount of waste that will occur in the production process and to meet the demands. In addition, the production of a single product in each slot of the machine and in a single run is a limitation of this project. In other words, two different products cannot be produced in one slot of the machine at the same time. To add, I need to use every slot in every run, as I want to make minimum waste.

For this project, I developed an algorithm using genetic algorithm.
